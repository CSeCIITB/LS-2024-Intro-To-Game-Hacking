## Part 1: Unbearable Revenge

In the middle of the island there is a place called the "Unbearable Woods" because of the numerous dangerous bears that reside there. 

There is also a chest containing a flag in the heart of the woods. However, to get the flag you have to show that you are worthy enough to survive the ferocious bears for 5 minutes. 

Your task is to get the flag from the chest. 

Write a detailed writeup explaining your approach to get the flag and include screenshots of the game and your hack script. Upload the writeup and any code used on a Github repository or Google Drive and submit the link to the repo/drive folder in this link: https://forms.gle/QyTs4Gx2RBbHGXCD7

## Part 2: Golden Eggs

When we decompiled the binary you might have noticed that there is a global variable called g_eggs in the `.bss` section of the binary. It is time to investigate into the mystery of the eggs!

10 golden eggs are scattered around various locations on the entire island. Your task is to find and collect all 10 eggs and on successfully doing so you will obtain a flag.
