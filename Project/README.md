## Part 2: Unbearable Revenge

In the middle of the island there is a place called the "Unbearable Woods" because of the numerous dangerous bears that reside there. 

There is also a chest containing a flag in the heart of the woods. However, to get the flag you have to show that you are worthy enough to survive the ferocious bears for 5 minutes. 

Can you get the flag?
