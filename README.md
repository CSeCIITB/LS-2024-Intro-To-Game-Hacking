We will primarily be focusing on this wonderful, intentionally vulnerable MMORPG: PwnAdenture3.

> Pwn Adventure 3: Pwnie Island is a limited-release, first-person, true open-world MMORPG set on a beautiful island where anything could happen. That's because this game is intentionally vulnerable to all kinds of silly hacks! Flying, endless cash, and more are all one client change or network proxy away. Are you ready for the mayhem?!

The true heroes, are the people who built the game <3

> Pwn Adventure 3 is the brainchild of one [Rusty Wagner](https://twitter.com/eipwned). He's responsible for the idea, the planning, and nearly all of the execution (programming, level design, quests, and so forth). Without him, there would be no game! Special thanks also goes to the Ghost in the Shellcode organizers for their support during development and testing.
